# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Charlottesville-Twitter-Rally

This repository contains the contents related to an undergraduate group project I participated in for my data analytics research class. This undergraduate group project revolved around producing insights relating to the 2017 political Charlottesville rally hosted in Charlottesville, VA. Our Groupâ€™s aim was to analyze the emotional and sentimental state of our country by analyzing the social media tweets tweeted around and after the rally. Qualitative, graphical, and quantitative insights relating to the term frequency, sentiment analysis and term distributions of the tweets were generated. 

This repository contains the slideshow containing all visualizations and insights generated for the project, as well as my personal R code behind the multi-dimensional scaling plot used for examining the term distributions across the thousands of tweets tweeted days after the Charlottesville rally. "Project 2 code (mds).R" contains the MDS plot code in R, while "Charlottesville Ralley Project.pdf" contains the entire project slideshow. It should be noted that to view the entire project slideshow, you may have to continously click the "More Pages" button available at the bottom of the page of the file.
